		<h1>6th Grade</h1>
		<p><h2>In 6th grade we learned the basics of computer programs like typing, Microsoft Excel, Word, Java script, and Power Point.</p>
		<p>We did projects with all of these like Elephants on word, Coding art with Java script, and classroom favorites on Excel. In this grade by the end of the year you needed to type 30wpm.</p>	
		<h1>7th Grade</h1>
		<p><h2>We learned more about pictures and art.</p>
		<p>We used programs like Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop, and Sketchup.</p>
		<p>We made projects on these like the icecream, my house, and magazine cover. At the end of the year we had to type 45wpm.</p>	
		<h1>8th Grade</h1>
		<p><h2>Finally, the last year. We learned coding, Garageband, filming, Storyboard, and Imovie.</p>
		<p>These programs have showed me insights on what goes on in the background of movies. We had to make a short film for a video contest. I had done my on spellebrity. We had to plan it out on storyboard then film it on a tablet, then use garage band for voice overs, and Imovie to put it all together. Also by the end of the year we had to type 60wpm.
		<h1>Reflection</h1>
		<p><h2>This class/program gave me expeience and hobbies I probably would of never had. It also let me have a better insights with new technology and how it really effects us. I would love to stay in this program for high school but sadly I can't. 	</body>
