		<h1>8th Grade</h1>
		<p><h2>Finally, the last year. We learned coding, garageband, filming, storyboard, and Imovie.</p>
		<p>These programs have showed me what goes on in the background of movies. We had to make a short film for a contest. I had done my on spellebrity. We had to plan it out on storyboard then film it the use garage band for voice and Imovie to put it all together. Also by the end of the year we had to type 60wpm.
		<h1>Reflection</h1>
		<p><h2>This class/program gave me expeience and hobbies I probably would of never had. It also let me have a better experience with new technology and how it really effects us. I would love to stay in this program for high school but sadly I can't. 	</body>
