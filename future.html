		<h2>High School</h2>
		<p>I want to go to McBride high school for 2 big reasons.</p>
		<p>Reason 1: The school majors in Engineering. To be more clear McBride has 3 majors Engineering, Medical, and Criminal Justice and Investigation.<br> Reason 2: The school is built for what teh majors are like  </p>	
		<h2>College</h2>
		<p>Our waterpark is the biggest and best park in the Western World. Just south of interstate 2015, you'll find a sweet mix of Super Slides and lazy rivers.</p>
		<p>If that wasn't enough, we have 376 of the best food trucks in the state serving everything from fried gummy bears to lemonade and pizza. Don't forget if you buy our collectors edition souvenir water park keepsake, you get free refills all year.</p>
		<p>And we wouldn't be SplashAnyone without the rules about splashing ... wait there are no rules.</p>	
		<h2>Career</h2>
		<p>Finally, you won't want to miss out cuddly little zoo animals. Lions, tigers and bears...Oh My! We have the largest selection of born in captivity animals. We didn't want to take the from their natural habitat, so we just got them from the other zoos in the state.</p>
