		<h2>Skateboarding</h2>
		<p>I have been riding skate boards sense I was 6 and I have learned what skateboard brands are better than others.</p>
<h3>Deck/Board</h3>
	<p>If I was just starting and I was 5 or 6 years old get a target board. Why you might ask since they are so cheap. Well i’ll tell you it’s because if you start out and buy a $50-$100 and then quit you lost all that money but if know you want to ride for a while buy a Plan B, Toy machine, ATM Click, or an Alien Workshop. </p>
<h3>Trucks/Bushings</h3>
	<p>Trucks and Bushings are really easy to find and usually come together. There are many different brands, but are only two types suspension and regular. I use both. I usually ride <a target="_blank" href= "http://venturetrucks.net/">venture</a> for regular and <a target="_blank" href= "http://avenuetrucks.com/">avenue</a> for suspension. 
		Here are the top 10 popular truck brands for regular Independent, Thunder, Venture, Tensor, Silver, Royal, Theeve, Krux, Destructo, and Grindking.<br> 
		I got these top 10 trucks from <a target="_blank" href= "http://www.thetoptens.com/top-skateboard-truck-brands/">here</a> and this list also tells you how they ride.</p>
<h3>Wheels/Bearings</h3>
<p>Wheels and bearings make you roll. Wheels have different sizes for different types of boards but most skateboarders use size 51. 
	There are many different brands for wheels and here are top 3 biggest <a target="_blank" href= "http://bones.com/skateboard-wheels">bones, </a>
	<a target="_blank" href= "http://www.spitfirewheels.com/">Spitfire </a> and,<a target="_blank" href= "http://rictawheels.com/"> Ricta, </a>
	Bearings go inside the wheels and certain brands go faster than others.</p>

	<h2>Skateboarders I look up to</h2>
	<p>Finally, you won't want to miss out cuddly little zoo animals. Lions, tigers and bears...Oh My! We have the largest selection of born in captivity animals. We didn't want to take the from their natural habitat, so we just got them from the other zoos in the state.</p>
