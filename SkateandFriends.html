<h1>Friends I skate with and where we Skate</h1>
		<p><h2>While most skateboarders go to their local skateparks my friends and I go around California to big famous skateparks and some hidden spots.</p>
		<p>My local skatepark is El Dorado skatepark, but I have been to more like Venice, Woodward, Woodward Pa, Houghton, Bellflower, Fremont, Plan B, Vans, Vans Huntington, and Volcom.</p>
		<p>Come check me and my friends skate at El Dorado.</p>	
		<h1>Skateboarding</h1>
		<p><h2>I have been riding skate boards sinse I was 6 and have learned what skateboard brands are better than others.</p>
<h1>Deck/Board</h1>
	<p><h2>If I was just starting and I was 5 or 6 years old get a target board. Why you might ask since they are so cheap? Well i’ll tell you it’s because if you start out and buy a $50-$100 and then quit you lost all that money, but if know you want to ride for a while buy a Plan B, Toy machine, ATM Click, or an Alien Workshop. </p>
<h1>Trucks/Bushings</h1>
	<p><h2>Trucks and Bushings are really easy to find and usually come together. There are many different brands, but are only two types suspension and regular. I use both. I usually ride <a target="_blank" href= "http://venturetrucks.net/">venture</a> for regular and <a target="_blank" href= "http://avenuetrucks.com/">avenue</a> for suspension. 
		Here are the top 10 popular truck brands for regular Independent, Thunder, Venture, Tensor, Silver, Royal, Theeve, Krux, Destructo, and Grindking.<br> 
		I got these top 10 trucks from <a target="_blank" href= "http://www.thetoptens.com/top-skateboard-truck-brands/">here</a> and this list also tells you how they ride.</p>
<h1>Wheels/Bearings</h1>
<p><h2 id="wheels">Wheels and bearings make you roll. Wheels have different sizes for different types of boards but most skateboarders use size 51. There are many different brands for wheels and here are top 3 biggest <a target="_blank" href= "http://bones.com/skateboard-wheels">Bones,</a> <a target="_blank" href= "http://www.spitfirewheels.com/">Spitfire,</a> and<a target="_blank" href= "http://rictawheels.com/"> Ricta.</a> Bearings go inside the wheels and certain brands go faster than others, but any brands of bearings works, but one of the biggest and most used brand is <a target="_blank" href= "http://bonesbearings.com/bones-reg-reds-reg-bearings-8-pack">Reds</a>.</p>
<h1 id="family">GripTape</h1>
<p><h2 id="family"> Grip tape make you have grip. All brands are the same but some have cool designs built/drawn in them. Most of the time when you buy a brand new board it comes with grip tape but sometimes you can customize it to have cutouts and look cooler. 
	I would not recommened spending alot of money on grip tape since it will get worn down and only used on that one board.</p> 
	
	<h1 id="family">Skateboarders I look up to</h1>
	<p><h2 id="family">Skateboarders/teams I look up and want to be like. One person I want to be like is tony Hawk and not because of the fame and richness but being able to do what he liked for so long and do it so well. I also look upto Chris Joslin because I skated with him when I first started and he would explain how to do a trick or other thing better than my dad who would also teach me. I lastly look up to the Plan B team for helping me on tricks when I go with Chris Joslin to their skate park.</p>
	<h1 id="family">Skate tricks I want to learn</h1>	
		<h2 id="family">
			flat: heal flip, nalie, nalie shove, nolie kick flip<br>
			street: rails, crook, feble, frontside crook, frontside tail slide<br>
			vert/ramp: 360, 540, sweep, boneless 180 shove, fakey staple gun
