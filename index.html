		<h2>Skills</h2>
		<p>Finally, the things Iâ€™am good at. I have a lot of skills but here are some balance, outdoors (fires, camping, survival), sports, math, learn new things quickly, and determination. I have always been determined in some way like getting something I want or getting a good grade in a class. I have learned that being determined to do something is the #1 part of getting something done.</p>
