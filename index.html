		<h1>Hobbies</h1>
		<p><h2>I have many different types of hobbies from coding and gaming to basketball and working out.</p>
		<p>You won't find me out on the couch usually, I will be outside learning new skateboard tricks and ride new bike trails or in my room working out math problems and codes. As you see I am a very busy person, but I can still have time for either friends or other activities.</p>
		<h1>Interest</h1>
		<p><h2>I have many interest ranging from conspiracy theories to new ideas of the future.</p>
		<p>I have most of these interest to help the future live longer and better. I have alot of interest and here are some of them math, science, conspiracy theories, and skateboarding. If you have catched on I love pushing my body and brain farther to become smarter in all subjects. </p>
		<h1>Skills</h1>
		<p><h2>Finally, the things I am good at. I have a lot of skills but here are some; balance, outdoors (fires, camping, survival), sports, math, learning new things quickly, and determination/growth mind set. 
		I have always been determined in some way like getting something I want or getting a good grade in a class. I have learned that being determined is the #1 part of getting something done.</p></h2>
